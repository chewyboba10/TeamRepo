      <h2>What is this game?</h2>
      <p> This is a geography game, in which you are given an image of somewhere within 4S Ranch or Del Sur and test either your observations skills or how well you know your high school's neighborhood.</p>
      <h2>How do I play?</h2>
      <h3>Step 1:</h3>
      <p> Click the 'Click to play' button.</p>
      <h3>Step 2:</h3>
      <p>The website will prompt you to enter a username before the game starts</p>
      <h3>Step 3:</h3>
      <p>A map of 4S Ranch/Del Sur will be displayed on the left and there will be a photo of somewhere in 4S Ranch/Del Sur on the right. Look at the photo displayed try to identify where it was taken.</p>
      <h3>Step 4:</h3>
      <p> The initial map is split into 4 quadrants. Click on a quadrant of the map where you think the photo was taken. The map will zoom in on the quadrant that you click on. This step repeats one more time. To reiterate, you may only 'zoom' in 2 to guess a location with in that section of the map.</p>
      <p>Note: You are able to go back to the larger map by clicking the esc key.</p>
      <h3>Step 5:</h3>
